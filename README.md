# Sage: The Unified C/C++ Orchestrator

![Sage Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viuvlabs/sage/main/docs/logo.png)
---

**Sage by [viuvlabs](https://github.com/viuvlabs) is the intelligent project and package manager that acts as the "missing piece" for modern C/C++ development. It elegantly unifies and orchestrates essential tools like CMake, Conan, Clang, and Ninja, bringing clarity, consistency, and control to your entire C/C++ workflow.**

## ✨ Why Sage?

Developing in C/C++ can often feel like assembling a complex puzzle, with disparate tools, dependencies, and build systems. Sage steps in to provide the much-needed cohesion, guiding your projects from conception to compilation with wisdom and precision.

* **Unified Workflow:** Say goodbye to juggling multiple command-line interfaces and configurations. Sage provides a single, intuitive entry point for all your C/C++ project needs.
* **Intelligent Orchestration:** Seamlessly integrates and manages industry-leading tools:
    * **CMake:** For robust and cross-platform build system generation.
    * **Conan:** For efficient C/C++ dependency management and package consumption.
    * **Clang:** For modern, fast, and feature-rich compilation.
    * **Ninja:** For lightning-fast build execution.
* **"The Missing Piece":** Designed to fill the gaps in the C/C++ ecosystem, Sage ensures your projects are structured, dependencies are resolved, and builds are consistent, regardless of complexity or platform.
* **Boost Productivity:** Reduce boilerplate, automate repetitive tasks, and focus on writing great C/C++ code, not on battling build systems.
* **Scalable & Maintainable:** Facilitates the creation of projects that are easier to manage, scale, and onboard new developers to.

  * **Dependency Management:** Seamless integration with Conan for declarative dependency resolution and consumption.
  * **Build System Generation:** Automated generation of CMake build scripts.
  * **Toolchain Integration:** Easy configuration and management of compilers (Clang), build tools (Ninja), and other development utilities.
  * **Testing & Linting:** Integrated commands for running tests and enforcing code style (e.g., clang-format, clang-tidy).
  * **Platform Agnostic:** Designed to work across various operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows).
  * **Extensible:** Built with extensibility in mind, allowing for custom commands and integrations.
